The Web Inspector for Android is powered by Google Chromeâ€™s DevTools and can be accessed by navigating to chrome://inspect in the Chrome browser. Your device or emulator should appear in the remote devices list if your Android application is running, and you can open the developer tools by clicking inspect on your device.
